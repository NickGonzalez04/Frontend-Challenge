## Guideline
``` It is a simple NFT contract that has functions for minting and putting NFTs for sale. ```

# For this challenge
- [X] use React.js to build a front-end with two views. 
- [X] First View: user collection page which shows all of the NFTs that they own. There should also be a button on this page to mint a new NFT into their collection. 
- [X] Second view: is a marketplace. Note that the marketplace does not need to be functional (i.e. you donâ€™t need to be able to transfer the NFTs).
- [X] pull in all of the NFT data
- [x] display some characteristics of each NFT whether it is on sale or not
- [x] the price of the NFT

## HINT: To test the marketplace, you need to have functionality to put the NFTs for sale in your React app.
